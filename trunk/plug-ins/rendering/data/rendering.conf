[Inclinated Plane]

#e+[0;60] Inclination of the plane, in degree :
#{It's a sort of inclination of the plane on the horizontal, regarding the vertical position, giving the 3D feeling.
# So setting it to 0 means the plane is not inclined at all (vertical).}
inclination = 35.

#b+ Use a flat separator instead of the defined separator icon ?
flat separator = true

#c4[0;1] If so, you can specify its color:
#{red, blue, green, alpha}
separator color = 0.9;0.9;1.0;0.8

[Caroussel]

#e[.35;.75] Percentage of the dock's width that appears on the foreground :
#{0.5 means the dock is half-folded, so half the icons are on the foreground,
#  and half are on the background}
foreground ratio = .5

#e[-10;50] Depth of the plane :
#{The greater, the deeper. It is in fact the gap between background icons' bottom and foreground icons' top (in pixels).}
gap on ellipse = 10

#b Always show icons' face ? (otherwise they will turn)
show face = false

[Parabolic]

#e[.1;2] Curvature :
curvature = .5

#e[.1;2] Ratio height/width :
ratio = 5

wave amplitude = .2
