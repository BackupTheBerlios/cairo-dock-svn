[Inclinated Plane]

#e+[0;60] Inclination of the plane :
#{In degrees, regarding the vertical position. It's a sort of inclination of the plane on the horizontal, giving the 3D feeling. So setting it to 0 means the plane is not inclined at all (vertical).}
inclination = 35.

#r+[Normal separator;Flat separator;Physical separator] Choose the way separators are drawn :
draw separator = 0

#c4[0;1] For flat separators, you can specify their color:
#{red, blue, green, alpha}
separator color = 0.9;0.9;1.0;0.8

#{0.5 means the dock is half-folded, so half the icons are on the foreground, and half are on the background.}

#e[-10;50] Depth of the plane :
#{The greater, the deeper. It is in fact the gap between background icons' bottom and foreground icons' top (in pixels).}

#{otherwise they will turn.}

#b Draw labels while unfolding ?
#{It may recquire more CPU during the unfolding animation, except if you launch Cairo-Dock with Glitz.}
