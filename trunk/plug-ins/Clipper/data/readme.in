This applet keeps a trace of the clipboard and mouse selection,
 so that you can recall them quickly. It's a clone of the well-know Klipper.
 It supports clipboard and mouse selection,
  predefined actions,
  and persistent items.
  Left-click to recall clipboard and mouse selection,
  drop text on the icon to create persistent items,
  and middle-clck to recall them.
