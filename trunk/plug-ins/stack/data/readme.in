@PACKAGE_STACK@ (v@VERSION_STACK@)
Author : ChAnGFu (RÃ©my Robertson) &amp; Fabounet (Fabrice Rey)
This applet allows you to build a stack of items,
just like the Stack applet of MacOS X.
Items can be files, folders, URL, or even pieces of text.
To add an item into your stack,
 just drag and drop it on the Stack icon and you're done.
 Enjoy!
