_("My machine is too old to run a composite manager")

_("Don\342\200\231t panic, Cairo-Dock can emulate the transparency.\nSo to get rid of the black background, just activate the corresponding option, in the end of the \342\200\234System\342\200\235 module")

_("The dock is horribly slow when I move the mouse into it")

_("Hint : ")

_("If you have a GeForce8, you have to install the latest drivers, because the first ones were really buggy.\nIf the dock is running without openGL, try to reduce the number of icons in the main dock, or try to reduce its size.\nIf the dock is running with openGL, try to deactivate it by launching the dock with \342\200\234cairo-dock \342\200\223c\342\200\235.")

_("I don\342\200\231t have these wonderful effects like fire, cube rotating, etc")

_("You need a graphic card with drivers that support openGL2.0. Most of Nvidia cards can do that, more and more Intel cards can do too. Most of ATI cards can\342\200\231t do that.")

_("The \342\200\234netspeed\342\200\235 applet displays 0 even when I\342\200\231m downloading something")

_("Hint : you can instantiate this applet many times if you want to monitor many interfaces.")

_("You have to tell it which interface you\342\200\231re using to connect to the Net (by default, it\342\200\231s \342\200\234eth0\342\200\235).\nJust edit its configuration, and enter the interface\342\200\231s name. To find it, type \342\200\234ifconfig\342\200\235 in a terminal, and ignore the \342\200\234loop\342\200\235 interface. It\342\200\231s probably something like \342\200\234eth1\342\200\235, \342\200\234ath0\342\200\235, or \342\200\234wifi0\342\200\235.")

_("The dustbin remains empty even when I delete a file")

_("if you\342\200\231re under KDE, you may have to tell it the path of the trash folder.\nJust edit the applet\342\200\231s configuration, and fill in the Trash path; it is probably \342\200\234~/.locale/share/Trash/files\342\200\235.
