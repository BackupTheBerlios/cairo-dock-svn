[Inclinated Plane]

#e+[0;60] Inclination of the plane, in degree :
#{It's a sort of inclination of the plane on the horizontal, regarding the vertical position, giving the 3D feeling.
# So setting it to 0 means the plane is not inclined at all (vertical).}
inclination=50.609000000000002

#b+ Use a flat separator instead of the defined separator icon ?
flat separator=true

#c4[0;1] If so, you can specify its color (red, blue, green, alpha):
separator color=1;1;1;1;

[Caroussel]

#e[.35;.75] Percentage of the dock's width that appears on the foreground :
#{0.5 means the dock is half-folded, so half the icons are on the foreground,
#  and half are on the background}
foreground ratio=0.5

#e[-10;50] Depth of the plane :
#{The greater, the deeper. It is in fact the gap between background icons' bottom and foreground icons' top (in pixels).}
gap on ellipse=10

#b Always show icons' face ? (otherwise they will turn)
show face=false
