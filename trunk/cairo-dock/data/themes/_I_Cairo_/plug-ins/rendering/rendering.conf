[Inclinated Plane]

#e+[0;60] Inclination of the plane :
#{In degrees, regarding the vertical position. It's a sort of inclination of the plane on the horizontal, giving the 3D feeling. So setting it to 0 means the plane is not inclined at all (vertical).}
inclination=35.

#b+ Use a flat separator instead of the defined separator icon ?
flat separator=true

#c4[0;1] If so, you can specify its color:
#{red, blue, green, alpha}
separator color=0.9;0.9;1.0;0.8


[Caroussel]

#e[.35;.75] Percentage of the dock's width that appears on the foreground :
#{0.5 means the dock is half-folded, so half the icons are on the foreground, and half are on the background.}
foreground ratio=.5

#e[-10;50] Depth of the plane :
#{The greater, the deeper. It is in fact the gap between background icons' bottom and foreground icons' top (in pixels).}
gap on ellipse=10

#b Always show icons' face ?
#{otherwise they will turn.}
show face=false


[Parabolic]

#e[0.1;2] Curvature :
#{it's the 'a' in y=k*x^a}
curvature=0.5

#e[0.1;10] Ratio height/width :
#{not including the labels. The 'k' coef will be adjusted to preserve this ratio.}
ratio=5

#e[0;1] Magnitude of the wave :
#{0 means the wave is totally flat, 1 means the wave is identical to other views.}
wave magnitude=0.20000000000000001

#i[0;20] Space between icons and their label :
#{in pixels.}
text gap=3
